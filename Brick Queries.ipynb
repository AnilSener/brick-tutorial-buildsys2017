    "One of the primary benefits of having a machine-readable representation of a building is the ability to build portable analytics. Rather than hard-coding the specific data streams and points from a building into an analytics script, we can discover that structure dynamically by querying the Brick model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this part of the tutorial is to demonstrate how to write SPARQL queries that pull information from such graphs, and how to use these queries to write portable analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help guide the queries we want to write, we've rendered a simple visualization of how class instances are connected in our sample building Brick model. The below figure tells us:\n",
    "- nodes of type `brick:VAV` have `feeds` relationships with nodes of type `brick:HVAC_Zone`\n",

    "\n",
    "There are only a few types of relationships (edge labels) that Brick captures, but these are sufficient for what we need. Here's a brief recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subcomponents**: `hasPart`/`isPartOf`. Used for mechanical composition, relating HVAC zones with physical spaces\n",
    "- **Identifying flows**: `feeds`/`isFedBy`. Used for flows of water, electricity, air, etc.\n",
    "- **Sensing + actuation**: `hasPoint`/`isPointOf`. Used for associating sensor, setpoints, statuses, commands, meters, etc with related equipment, locations, etc\n",
    "- **Location**: `hasLocation`/`isLocationOf`. Identifies the physical location of something\n",
    "- **Instantiation**: `type` (implicit in the graph above)\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we write SPARQL queries is by considering the types of \"things\" we care about as well as the nature of the relationships between those things."

The most important part of this boilerplate are the namespace abbreviations.\n",
    "\n",

All URIs have a namespace: for example in the URI `https://brickschema.org/schema/1.0.1/Brick#VAV`, the namespace is `https://brickschema.org/schema/1.0.1/Brick#` and the \"node\" is `VAV`.
